# CIS Benchmark Ansible Script

This repository contains an Ansible script designed to automate the application of CIS benchmarks for various Linux flavors. The script applies Level 1 and Level 2 benchmarks separately, ensuring your systems adhere to security best practices.

## Features

- Automates CIS benchmark application for Linux servers.
- Supports both cloud and on-premises environments.
- Separate application of Level 1 and Level 2 benchmarks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ansible installed on your local machine.
- Access to the target servers with sufficient permissions to apply security changes.
- Knowledge of the CIS benchmarks and their implications for your environment.

### Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vireshsolanki/cis-benchmark-ansible.git
   cd cis-benchmark-ansible
   ```


## Important Considerations

- **Cloud vs. On-Premises:**
  - The script is optimized for on-premises servers but may affect cloud resources differently. Changes could potentially disrupt or break certain packages. Be sure to review and test thoroughly after application.
  - Restart the server if necessary to apply changes fully.

- **Post-Application:**
  - Review your system's functionality after applying the benchmarks. Ensure that all services are running correctly and no unintended changes have occurred.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues with the script, please raise an issue on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/vireshsolanki/cis-benchmark-ansible/issues). We will provide support and work on resolving any problems you may face.

## Future Updates

We are working on creating scripts for other operating systems and will update this repository accordingly. Stay tuned for more updates.
